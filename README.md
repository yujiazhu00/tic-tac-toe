<p>I modified the "AI" algorithm in the Object Oriented tic tac toe program by John Hunt, <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030202897">A Beginners Guide to Python 3 Programming</a>, Chapter 37 based on the algorithm by <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter10.html">Al Sweigart</a>. The latter program is not written as Object Oriented Code.</p>
